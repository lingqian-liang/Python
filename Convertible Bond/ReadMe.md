# Convertible Bond
This project can be divided into two parts. The first one is to analyzed all issued Convertible Bonds (CB) from 2008 to 2018 to study trends, 6-month correlations between CB`s performance
and that of underlying stocks under various market conditions and relationship between YTM and stock value of CBs. The second part is to implemented and backtested ZL model to price and valuate Chinese Convertible Bonds in Python via Monte Carlo simulation and
extended BS model (convertible bond value=call option+ bond value+ earned interest) to derive implied sell back stock price, call
back stock price, sell back and call back timing.

##How to use this code
"Convertible" is the file describing the empirical results and "ZL Model" describes how to implement the ZL Model to valuate convertible bonds` prices.
